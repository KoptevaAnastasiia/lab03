# Lab work: Recommendation algorithm based on SVD (Singular Schedule)

## Job description
This project implements a movie recommendation algorithm using the data dimensionality reduction technique - SVD (singular matrix decomposition). The goal is to build recommendations for users and visualize similarities between users and movies based on their ratings.

The project consists of several parts:
1. Implementation of the SVD algorithm without using built-in functions.
2. Visualization of similarity of users and movies using dimensionality reduction.
3. Creating recommendations based on predicted user ratings.


## Dependencies
For the correct operation of the project, it is necessary to have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy'
- ``pandas''
- `scipy'
- `matplotlib`
